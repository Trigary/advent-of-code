# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles.

Each year has its own subfolder, and the inputs are expected to be placed in files named `<day_num>.txt`.

I do my best to solve the puzzles without using any hints, so my solutions might not always be the most optimal.
